User Instruction:
Run the parser.py and select docs/sample.txt

Programmer Problem:
Could not solve parser table.
My scanner-Alex is not correct, specifically all the tables.

Programmer Note:
In the end, I'm using the professor scanner because of the familiarity.
My parser is not successful and there is a lot of materials to learn about compiler but I did learn.

Special Thanks:
Thanks to Professor Anthony Giacalone for the original project; to work on the assignment of CECS 444.
