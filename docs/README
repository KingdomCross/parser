The parser is complete according to the specifications outlined on the project sheet. Two samples have been provided, along with screenshots of the GUI. Some highlights:

1. Complete GUI input and output with file selection
2. Fully integrated with the scanner
3. Built to recognize pop and scan errors, and report the issue appropriately.
4. 'Plug and Play' tables and lookup tokens -- easily altered or integrated with other programs
5. Class structure is made to allow further development
6. Error handling (try/catch) for bad input
